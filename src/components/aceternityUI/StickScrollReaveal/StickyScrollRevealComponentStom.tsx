    My next focus is on enhancing the user experience by organizing routes better and ensuring smooth navigation. 
    I plan to introduce user authentication, allowing users to log in and save their favorite games for easy access. 
    This will provide a more personalized experience and add value for returning users. 

    I'll also implement features like loading spinners, intuitive error messages, and more responsive design elements 
    to ensure a seamless and engaging browsing experience. The goal is to make Game Finder not only functional but enjoyable to use.
